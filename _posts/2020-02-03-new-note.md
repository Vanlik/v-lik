Hi, welcome to my first ever post. My name is Vanlik(or in Japanese リク). Writing has never been my top priority in my daily activity despite of its importance. So by setting up a space to writing more on this blog, I expect to improve the skill to the point of satisfaction. ^[I usually handwrite all my notes (Like this [one](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13H_1X5MR2p4hoSaOnkcxW446eN044wbd/view)). This is a note I wrote back in 2018 as a draft of my reserach idea on the analysis of incentive to collude on ride-hailing platform.]

On this blog, you would expect to see my writing on variety of topics including history, culture, philosophy, science, etc. This does not necessarily mean that I'm the expert. Rather, I would reference from scientific reserach which are mainly the quests with regards to such topics that I have touched. So all constructive comments and discussion are more than welcome in the sole purpose of attaining knowledge. 

Enjoy the ride!!!
