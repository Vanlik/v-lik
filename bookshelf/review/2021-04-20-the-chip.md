Hi, welcome to my first ever post. My name is Vanlik(or in Japanese リク). Writing has never been my top priority in my daily activity despite of its importance. So by setting up a space to writing more on this blog, I hope to improve the skill to the point of satisfaction.[^1]

[^1]: I usually handwrite all my notes (Like this [one](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13H_1X5MR2p4hoSaOnkcxW446eN044wbd/view)). This is a note I wrote back in 2018 as a draft of my research idea on the analysis of incentive to collude on ride-hailing platform.

As stated in my bio, I am majoring in Economics, in industrial organization or IO specifically. In IO, we use often use tools like [game theory](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/) to analyze market power and firm's strategic behaviors in the market. Given that we have now can get hand on enormous amount of firm data, the field of empirical IO has emerged to a more rigorous level, enabling us to apply quantitative tasks using econometrics. I will touch upon many topics related to information economics, network effects and multi-sided platform competitions. 

On this blog, I will also write something on variety of topics including history, culture, philosophy, science, etc. This does not necessarily mean that I'm the expert in those particular fields. So all constructive comments and discussion are more than welcome in the sole purpose of attaining knowledge. 

Enjoy the ride!!!
