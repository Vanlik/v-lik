### No School

Growing up I never thought I would have got a proper education. My dad did not get his junior diploma while my mom managed to make it until high school. [Brutal genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide) during 1975-1979 killed roughly 2 million innocent people including well-educated ones, leaving Cambodia decades of extreme poverty and ineffective public institutions.
