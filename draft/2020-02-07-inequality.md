## Inequality

Types of inequality: Wealth, opportunity,... 
Model: Physicists, Mathematicians, and Economists


**Scientific American**, [Is Inequality Inevitable?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-inequality-inevitable/)
Conlcusion: inequality needs to be tackled with efficient mmechanism (not free market given $\zeta > \chi$ in the AWM model)
This model predicts that wealth concentration happens no matter how unequal first endowment people is. At the end of day, there would be (partial) oligarchy who ends up control the entire wealth. (Quite more provocative than economists)

**JEP**, [The Top 1 Percent in International and Historical Perspective](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.27.3.3)

Because people cannot lose what they do not have, the amount of wealth that can be won or lost is constrained to be a fraction of the wealth of the poorer of the two agents

Fundamental Theorem of Welfare economics

1. First: Free market leads to pareto-efficient outcome [Free market or Socialism](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/free-market-or-socialism-have-economists-really-anything-to-say)

2. Second: Redistribution ...

> These implications are often summarized by the “First Theorem of Welfare Economics,” which identifies sufficient conditions for any equilibrium allocation, or distribution of resources, in an economy in which agents trade in perfectly competitive markets to be “Pareto-efficient:” this means that, starting from any such allocation, there does not exist a way to redistribute resources that makes all agents better off. Although this theorem permits a broad range of interpretations, depending on our reading of the sufficient conditions, a prominent one acknowledges it as a modern reformulation of the invisible hand, in which the informal style of Adam Smith’s (1776) arguments gives way to the dry language of modern mathematics. The bottom line, conveyed by most economics textbooks since its inception, is that a perfectly competitive free-market system tends to implement an efficient allocation of economic resources.

And:

>But because it postulates a free-market system, the First Theorem of Welfare Economics offers little if any guidance as to compare the market mechanism with different allocation rules. The “Second Theorem of Welfare Economics” sets the stage for such a comparison. It takes as given the set of Pareto-efficient allocations, and provides sufficient conditions under which any such allocation can be achieved through trade in perfectly competitive markets, once the government commits to an appropriate lump-sum redistribution of resources. That would be a fiscal intervention based on individuals’ characteristics rather than on their market behavior

However, Vilfredo Pareto (1906) made a remark:

> Pareto-efficient allocation can be obtained by command, imposing a social control over production. 

## Free Market is Goo...(either good or goofy)

How socialist scholars like Oskar Lange (1936, 1938), Abba Lerner (1944) and Fred M. Taylor (1948) attests the idea that market socialist economy could reach the same outcome as the descentralized economy in terms of efficiency, theoretically. (!!!)
